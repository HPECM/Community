		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">Overview</h2>

		<p>This add-in allows you to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				register a document in CM by creating a Record linked to this document,
			</li>
			<li>check the document into the linked Record,</li>
			<li>request deletion of the document in OneDrive,</li>
			<li>finalise the Record,</li>
			<li>link to the Record in the Content Manager Web Client,</li>
			<li>favorite the record,</li>
			<li>view the record properties,</li>
			<li>
				request sharing of a Record already checked out by another user, and
			</li>
			<li>open a record from Content Manager.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Registering a document
		</h2>
		To register a document into Content Manager:
		<ol>
			<li>from the Content Manager ribbon tab select 'Record',</li>
			<li>from the Task Pane choose a Record Type,</li>
			<li>supply the required properties on the Record, then</li>
			<li>click the 'Register in Content Manager' button.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Support in OneDrive local and web
		</h2>
		<p>
			The integration should work seamlessly no matter how the file is opened
			from OneDrive, including:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>OneDrive Web Site,</li>
			<li>locally synced OneDrive files,</li>
			<li>open from OneDrive in desktop Office application, or</li>
			<li>document stored in SharePoint document library</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Office support
		</h2>
		<p>The only Office applications supported by this integration are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Word,</li>
			<li>Excel, and</li>
			<li>PowerPoint.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Viewing the Record properties
		</h2>
		<p>
			Once the document has been filed in Content Manager the task pane should
			open automatically to display the list of properties available in the
			Content Manager view pane. If this task pane is not open it may be opened
			using the same 'Record' menu option as was used to originally register
			them document.
		</p>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Transferring a document to Content Manager
		</h2>
		<p>
			Once the document has been registered in Content Manager its content may
			be updated in one of two ways:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				manually, by selecting the 'Check in an Electronic Document' option in
				the Task Pane menu, or
			</li>
			<li>
				automatically on close by selecting the 'Enable check in and delete on
				close' option from the Task Pane menu.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Re-opening a document from Content Manager
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you have used the 'Check in and delete on close' method to update a
			Record in Content Manager then a link to that Record will have been
			created for you in OneDrive. This link may be used to re-open the Record.
			Opening the record will cause it to be checked out to you and a copy of
			the document placed in your 'Content Manager Documents' folder in
			OneDrive.
		</p>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Previewing a document from Content Manager
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you have used the 'Check in and delete on close' method to update a
			Record in Content Manager then a link to that Record will have been
			created for you in OneDrive. This link may be used to preview the document
			within Content Manager. The ellipsis menu on the document contains a
			'preview' option, this will open a PDF rendition of the document from
			within Content Manager for preview. From this preview you may to choose to
			open the actual document which will cause it to be copied back into your
			'Content Manager Documents' folder in OneDrive.
		</p>
		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Sharing a Record
		</h2>
		<p>
			The integration will prompt you to send a request to share a Record if you
			use the open dialog to find a Record in Content Manager that is already
			checked out to someone elses OneDrive. If the owner of the checked out
			Record allows sharing you will be able to edit the instance in their
			OneDrive but only they will have permission to check the document into
			Content Manager.
		</p>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Paste Record Details
		</h2>
		<p>
			The context menu in the task pane contains a 'paste' item which allows you
			to paste the:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Record Title,</li>
			<li>Record Number, or</li>
			<li>a link to the Record in the Web Client.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			These paste menu is availeble both in the context menu for the current
			Record and also in the list of Records displayed inside the Context tab.
		</p>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Record Context
		</h2>

		<p>
			Once a document has been registered in Content Manager the the Task Pane
			should open automatically whenever the document is opening. This Task Pane
			contains a Context tab with quick links to those Records that are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>in the same container,</li>
			<li>have the same contacts, or</li>
			<li>are related to.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The context pane may also be used to do a search for any Record in Content
			Manager.
		</p>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			User Interface Components
		</h2>

		<h3 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">Quick Select</h3>
		<p>
			Fields in the Record entry form that contain Content Manager objects, such
			as Container or Author, are populated using quick select fields. These
			quick select fields are simpler than the corresponding fields in either
			the desktop or web clients, you may find an object by:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				clicking the magnifying glass than selecting one of the shortcut icons
				to the left of the of the list
			</li>
			<li>typing in the field to do a simple search (by name or title)</li>
			<li>
				clicking the spanner icon at the left of the field to toggle into
				advanced search which allows you to use the Content Manager search
				language in the field, for example `contains:all' to find a Records that
				contain at least one other Record.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Once you have found the appropriate object in the list select it to
			populate the field.
		</p>

		<h3 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">Open dialog</h3>
		<p>
			The open dialog allows you to search all Records in CM, even non
			electronic ones. To use it:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>enter a search term (or select a shortcut from the left)</li>
			<li>wait for the result list to populate</li>
			<li>select a Record</li>
			<li>click OK</li>
			<li>
				if the Document already exists in O365 it will be opened, if not it will
				be copied to the folder 'Content Manager Documents' from CM and then
				opened.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h3 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Record Entry form tabs
		</h3>
		<p>
			The tabs used in the record entry form have to fit into the width of the
			task pane, for this reason they have an overflow feature. If there is more
			than one tab in the Record Entry form and it is likely the combined size
			of the tabs will be larger than the available width then overflowing tabs
			will be shown not as tabs but in the overflow menu, represented by the an
			ellipsis menu.
		</p>

		<h3 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Properties Pane
		</h3>
		<p>
			Records and Check in Places are displayed using the properties pane, this
			is the pane that is displayed in the task pane when you select the
			'Record' menu item for an item that exists in Content Manager. The
			properties pane shows the list of properties you have selected to show in
			the View Pane. To remove a property from display use the X icon to the
			right of the property value. To add a property use the combobox at the
			bottom of the pane to choose the property then select 'Add'. To reset the
			displayed properties to the default choose 'Get default properties and
			fields for view pane' from the context menu.
