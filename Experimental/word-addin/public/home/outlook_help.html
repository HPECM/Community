		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">Overview</h2>

		<p>This add-in allows you to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				register an individual email in Content Manager,
			</li>
			<li>register the attachments on an email in Content Manager,</li>
			<li>
				move one or more emails to a linked folder causing them to be filed in
				Content Manager,
			</li>
			<li>
				create Checkin Styles which contain pre=set a particular Record Type and
				default values for various Record properties,
			</li>
			<li>create a linked folder,</li>
			<li>set the default Record Type</li>
			<li>
				pin the Record task pane to avoid having to access the menu repeatedly
				when you have multiple emails to file or view in Content Manager.
			</li>
			<li>
				view and edit the Record properties once an email is filed in Content
				Manager, and
			</li>
			<li>
				easily navigate to other Records related to this Record from the context
				tab.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			The Content Manager menu
		</h2>
		<p>
			The menu for the Content Manager integration is found in the ribbon in
			desktop Outlook but in the 'More actions' menu within a mail item in
			Outlook Online. Throughout this documentation it will be referred to as
			'the menu'.
		</p>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">File a single email</h2>
		<p>
			To file a single email, or attachments from a single email:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>select the email</li>
			<li>from the menu select 'Record'</li>
			<li>select a Record Type or Check in Style, then</li>
			<li>enter the details and click 'Register in Content Manager.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If there are attachments on the email the first screen, instead of showing
			the Record Type quick select, will allow you to choose one or more
			attachments and/or the email itself. At this point you may also choose to
			bypass the data entry form.
		</p>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Create a Check in Style
		</h2>

		<p>
			A Check in Style is simply a way to set up default values in Record
			properties. For example if you have fields that always contain the same
			value whenever you file email from a particular customer you might create
			a Check in Style to save re-entering those values every time.To create a
			Check in Style:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>from the menu select 'Linked Folders',</li>
			<li>
				from the context menu in the linked folder list select the 'New Check in
				Style' icon,
			</li>
			<li>select a Record Type and enter default values in fields, then</li>
			<li>select 'Register in Content Manager'.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Create a linked folder
		</h2>
		<p>
			A linked folder is a special type of Check in Style that has a link to one
			of the folders in your mail box. This allows the server side component of
			the integration to monitor these linked folders and register any mail item
			that is moved to the folder according to the settings in the Check in
			Style. Because the email is filed by a server process linked folders do
			not allow you to access the data entry form when you move the item to the
			folder. To create a linked folder:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>from the menu select 'Linked Folders',</li>
			<li>
				from the context menu in the linked folder list select the 'New Linked
				Folder' icon,
			</li>
			<li>
				select either a pre-existing folder or choose 'Auto Create New Folder'
				to have the integration create a folder for you,
			</li>
			<li>
				select a Record Type and fill in any properties you want to be used as
				defaults on items filed using this folder
			</li>
			<li>
				the 'Processing' tab contains properties that determine how this folder
				behaves, does it file only attachments on emails and does it delete mail
				items from Outlook as the are filed to Content Manager.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Record Context
		</h2>

		<p>
			Once a document has been registered in Content Manager the the Task Pane
			should open automatically whenever the document is opening. This Task Pane
			contains a Context tab with quick links to those Records that are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>in the same container</li>
			<li>have the same contacts, or</li>
			<li>are related to.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The context pane may also be used to do a search for any Record in Content
			Manager.
		</p>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			User Options
		</h2>
		<p>The User Options menu item allows you to set the default Record Type.</p>

		<h2 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			User Interface Components
		</h2>

		<h3 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">Quick Select</h3>
		<p>
			Fields in the Record entry form that contain Content Manager objects, such
			as Container or Author, are populated using quick select fields. These
			quick select fields are simpler than the corresponding fields in either
			the desktop or web clients, you may find an object by:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				clicking the magnifying glass than selecting one of the shortcut icons
				to the left of the of the list
			</li>
			<li>typing in the field to do a simple search (by name or title)</li>
			<li>
				clicking the spanner icon at the left of the field to toggle into
				advanced search which allows you to use the Content Manager search
				language in the field, for example `contains:all' to find a Records that
				contain at least one other Record.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Once you have found the appropriate object in the list select it to
			populate the field.
		</p>

		<h3 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Record Entry form tabs
		</h3>
		<p>
			The tabs used in the record entry form have to fit into the width of the
			task pane, for this reason they have an overflow feature. If there is more
			than one tab in the Record Entry form and it is likely the combined size
			of the tabs will be larger than the available width then overflowing tabs
			will be shown not as tabs but in the overflow menu, represented by the an
			ellipsis menu.
		</p>

		<h3 class="ms-fontSize-28 ms-fontWeight-semibold">
			Properties Pane
		</h3>
		<p>
			Records and Check in Places are displayed using the properties pane, this
			is the pane that is displayed in the task pane when you select the
			'Record' menu item for an item that exists in Content Manager. The
			properties pane shows the list of properties you have selected to show in
			the View Pane. To remove a propery from display use the X icon to the
			right of the property value. To add a propert use the combobox at the
			bottom of the pane to choose the property then select 'Add'. To reset the
			displayed properties to the default choose 'Get default properties andf
			fields for view pane' from the context menu.
